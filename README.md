# Quantum Trader
This is a piece of software that aims to predict stock prices using ML models and a popular deep learning frameowrk called PyTorch.

## Future Development üõ£Ô∏è
Here are some things we aim to continue adding to this project:
- Dynamically changing the sequence length (also known as a look back window)
- Dynamically calculating how much we need to scale the data in order to get the best results
- Using more data such as indicators and incorporating that into our model
- Creating a front end web app to make it easier to interact with the model and see the predictions
- Potentially creating a simple NLP model

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è
Prerequesites (everything listed below will already be included in Google Colab):
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Python

1. Open the `model.ipynb` file to find the main ML model and click "Run All". Then you will see the predicted price (by default the close price) at the bottom.
2. You can also take a look into `prophet.ipynb` which uses a different library to predict stocks and shows the data in a different way.
